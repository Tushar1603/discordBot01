# discordBot01
 
Description: In this group assignment, we've made a discord bot as our product using node.js. It  has been linked directly to the discord group itself and is in function.

Extensions used: npm install discord.js
                 npm init -y
                 prettier (vs code extension, which is very helpful in keeping a clean working place)

Link to the channel: https://discord.gg/GZNP6pfC

Members: Tushar, Damanpreet, Deepinder, Harpreet and Manpreet. (All the members are the collaborators in this repository.)

Steps followed:
     used bash comments like npm init -y and npm install discord.js to set the base
     then followed it with some code to add some features to the bot and linked it to the discord channel using the bot token.
     Features added include a random number generator and a rolling dice etc.
     Also added a greeting command to the code to greet a new user.
     Limited the interruptions of the bot
