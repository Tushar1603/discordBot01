# discordBot01
 
Description: In this group assignment, we've made a discord bot as our product using node.js. It  has been linked directly to the discord group itself and is in function.

Extensions used: npm install discord.js
                 npm init -y
                 prettier (vs code extension, which is very helpful in keeping a clean working place)
                 npm install dotenv
